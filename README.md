## 🚀 Quick Start

### Compile and Run

```bash
# Navigate to any topic
cd src/01-basics

# Compile
javac HelloWorld.java

# Run
java HelloWorld
```

### Using an IDE

1. **IntelliJ IDEA:**
   - File → Open → Select `Java-Foundation-Complete` folder
   - Right-click on any .java file → Run

2. **Eclipse:**
   - File → Import → Existing Projects → Select this folder
   - Right-click on file → Run As → Java Application

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Start Sequential:** Work through 01-basics → 02-control → ... → 05-file-basics
2. **Type Code Yourself:** Don't copy-paste, typing helps memory
3. **Experiment:** Modify examples to see different outcomes
4. **Debug:** Use IDE debugger to step through code
5. **Build Projects:** Combine concepts (e.g., Student Management with file storage)

## 📖 Example: Running Your First Program

```bash
# 1. Navigate to basics folder
cd Java-Foundation-Complete/src/01-basics

# 2. Create HelloWorld.java
# (or use existing file)

# 3. Compile
javac HelloWorld.java

# 4. Run
java HelloWorld
# Output: Hello, World!
```
